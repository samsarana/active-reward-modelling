1. Create a new VM with ssh public key from your laptop
2. ssh into it
3. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "samckclarke@gmail.com"
4. Add VM's public ssh key to my github

5. git clone git@github.com:sckclarke/barm.git
6. Then your're good to go! bash setup_script.sh

NB I haven't checked that the script in its entirely works, yet
